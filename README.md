             Hello
Please this the desktop application of the hospital software.
Initially only admin can log in then latter can add more users.
To login as admin
Username: admin
Password: admin
When you login as admin you can add secretaries and doctors name and password
Secretary can create profile for patient then book appointment for the doctor. There are two users inside already that you cannot delete.
The doctor can only see the appointments, edit then, add notes to it. He may decide to save it or delete it.
The mobile version will be ready by tomorrow or tomorrow next. I am using react native for the mobile version. database is attached to it.
Thanks. 

Need .net framework 4.0 to run.
